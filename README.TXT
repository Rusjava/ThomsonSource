The folder contains two auxiliary programs:
ShadowFileConverter - a utilite that converts Shadow complex binary files into the text format and from the text format to binary files
TSourceAnalyser - a utilite that that displays electron distributions generated by ring_bunch.exe program and compares them with Gaussian distributions
