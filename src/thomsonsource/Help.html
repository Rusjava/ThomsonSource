  <h1>TSource application user guide</h1>
  <p>The TSource application is intended as tool to make a fast estimate of the main Thompson source parameters such as:
	the X-ray photon flux in the given direction, spectral brilliance in a given direction.</p>
    
  <p>The application consists of the main window, where one can specify the parameters of the Thompson source as well as plot 2D and 1D
	flux, energy and spectral brilliance distributions in the form of color plots, and two calculation boxes where one can obtain
	and plot estimates of the geometric factor and brilliance in the forward direction as function of a number of parameters.</p>
	
	<p>The parameters from the main window can be saved to the file and loaded from the file. The plots from the calculation boxes 
	can be save to a file as well.</p>
	
	<h2>Parameters</h2>
	<h3>Electron bunch parameters</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li>Electron energy &ndash; the average energy of the electrons in MeV</li>
    	<li>Charge &ndash; the electric charge of the bunch in nQ</li>
		<li>Spread &ndash; the relative energy spread of the electrons</li>
		<li>Length &ndash; the length of the electron bunch in ps</li>
		<li>Emittance &ndash; the emittance of the bunch in mm&times;mrad</li>
		<li>Beta x &ndash; the beta function at the point of interaction in the x direction</li>
		<li>Beta y &ndash; the beta function at the point of interaction in the y direction</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<h3>Laser pulse parameters</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li>Photon energy &ndash; the average energy of the photons in eV</li>
    	<li>Pulse energy &ndash; the energy of the laser pulse in mJ</li>
		<li>Length &ndash; the length of the laser pulse in ps</li>
		<li>Rayleigh length &ndash; the Rayleigh length  of the laser pulse in mm</li>
		<li>Pulse frequency &ndash; the number of laser pulses per second in MHz</li>
		<li>Delay &ndash; the temporal delay of the laser pulse relative to the electron bunch in ps</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<h3>Relative position</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li>X-shift &ndash; the spatial shift of the electron bunch relative to the laser pulse in x direction in mm</li>
    	<li>Y-shift &ndash; the spatial shift of the electron bunch relative to the laser pulse in y direction in mm</li>
		<li>Z-shift &ndash; the spatial shift of the electron bunch relative to the laser pulse in z direction in mm</li>
		<li>Angle &ndash; the angle between direction of the electron bunch and the laser pulse in mrad. Rotation is thought to occur about x-axis</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<h2>Graphs</h2>
	<h3>X-ray flux tab</h3>
	<p>The left color plot shows the X-ray photon flux (in mm<sup>&minus;2</sup>&times;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>) in a particular direction relative
	 to the direction of the electron bunch. The right color plot shows the X-ray photon spectral flux (in 
	 mm<sup>&minus;2</sup>&times;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>&times;0.1%) for a particular angle and particular energy at the angular position corresponding
	 to the slider position below the left plot.</p>
	 
	<h3>X-ray energy tab</h3>
	<p>The left color plot shows the X-ray photon energy (in keV) in a particular direction relative to the direction of the electron bunch.
	 The right plot shows the cross-section X-ray photon energy (in keV) at the angular position corresponding to the slider position below 
	 the left plot.</p>
	 
	 <h2>File menu</h2>
	 <p>This menu allows one to save (<b>File</b> -> <b>Save parameters</b>) the parameters from the main window to a file and load (<b>File</b> 
	 -> <b>Load parameters</b>) them from a file.</p>
	 
	<h2>Calculation menu</h2>
	<p>The <b>Calculation</b> menu provides access to two calculations boxes: for the spectral brilliance in the direction of the electron bunch and 
	the geometric factor. These quantities are calculated by pressing <b>Calculate</b> button and can be plotted as a function of a number of parameters,
	which can be chosen from a drop-down box. The desirable parameter range can be entered via two text fields. All other necessary parameters are taken 
	from the main window of the program. The results of calculation can be saved as a text file using <b>Save</b> button.</p>
	
	<p>The brilliance calculation box also allows to choose whether the transversal velocity spread of the electrons is taken into account.</p>
	
	<h2>Shadow menu</h2>
	<p>The <b>Shadow</b> menu allows one to generate a set of rays for the use as an X-ray source in Shadow ray-tracing software. 
	To choose the number of generated rays use <b>Shadow</b> -> <b>Parameters</b> dialog</p>.
	
	<h2>Option menu</h2>
	<p>Option menu provides access to additional graph parameters via <b>Options</b> -> <b>Graph parameters</b> as well as to the Monte-Carlo integration parameters
	 via <b>Options</b> -> <b>Monte-Carlo parameters</b>. <b>Options</b> -> <b>Velocity spread</b> specifies whether the traversal velocity spread is taken
	 into account in the main window calculations and also while generating a set of rays for Shadow.</p>
