        <h1>TSource application user guide</h1>
        <p>The TSource application is intended as a tool to make fast estimates of the main Thompson source parameters such as:
	the total photon flux, the X-ray photon flux in the given direction and spectral brilliance in a given direction.</p>
    
        <p>The application consists of the main window, where one can specify the parameters of the Thompson source as well as plot
	photon flux, photon energy and spectral brilliance distributions in the form of 2D color plots and 1D line plots, and two calculation
	boxes where one can obtain and plot estimates of the geometric factor and brilliance in in the specified direction and at the specified energy
	as function of a number of parameters.</p>
    
	<p>The parameters from the main window can be saved to the file and loaded from the file. The plots from the calculation boxes 
	can be saved to a file as well.</p>
    </div>

	<h2>Parameters</h2>
	<h3>Electron bunch parameters</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li>Electron energy &ndash; the average energy of the electrons in MeV</li>
    	<li>Charge &ndash; the electric charge of the bunch in nQ</li>
		<li>Spread &ndash; the relative energy spread of the electrons</li>
		<li>Length &ndash; the length of the electron bunch in ps</li>
		<li>Emittance &ndash; the emittance of the bunch in mm&times;mrad</li>
		<li>Beta x &ndash; the beta function at the point of interaction in the x direction</li>
		<li>Beta y &ndash; the beta function at the point of interaction in the y direction</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<h3>Laser pulse parameters</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li>Photon energy &ndash; the average energy of the photons in eV</li>
    	<li>Pulse energy &ndash; the energy of the laser pulse in mJ</li>
		<li>Length &ndash; the length of the laser pulse in ps</li>
		<li>Rayleigh length &ndash; the Rayleigh length of the laser pulse in mm</li>
		<li>Pulse frequency &ndash; the number of laser pulses per second in MHz</li>
		<li>Delay &ndash; the temporal delay of the laser pulse relative to the electron bunch in ps</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<h3>Relative position</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li>X-shift &ndash; the spatial shift of the electron bunch relative to the laser pulse in x direction in mm</li>
    	<li>Y-shift &ndash; the spatial shift of the electron bunch relative to the laser pulse in y direction in mm</li>
		<li>Z-shift &ndash; the spatial shift of the electron bunch relative to the laser pulse in z direction in mm</li>
		<li>Angle &ndash; the angle between direction of the electron bunch and the laser pulse in mrad. Rotation is thought to occur about x-axis</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<h2>Graphs</h2>
	<h3>X-ray flux tab</h3>
	<p>The left color plot shows the X-ray photon flux (in mm<sup>&minus;2</sup>&times;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>) as a function of the X-ray photon direction relative
	 to the direction of the electron bunch. The right color plot shows the X-ray photon spectral flux (in mm<sup>&minus;2</sup>&times;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>&times;0.1%)
	 as a function of observation angle and energy at the angular position corresponding to the slider position below the left plot.</p>
	 
	<h3>X-ray energy tab</h3>
	<p>The left color plot shows the X-ray photon energy (in keV) as a function of the X-ray photon direction relative to the direction of the electron bunch.
	 The right plot shows the cross-section of X-ray photon energy (in keV) at the angular position corresponding to the slider position below 
	 the left plot.</p>
	 
	 <h2>File menu</h2>
	 <p>This menu allows one to save (<em>File</em> -> <em>Save parameters</em>) the source parameters from the main window to a file and load (<em>File</em> 
	 -> <em>Load parameters</em>) them from a file.</p>
	 
	<h2>Calculation menu</h2>
	<p>The <em>Calculation</em> menu provides access to two calculations boxes: for the spectral brilliance of the X-ray radiation and 
	the geometric factor. These quantities are calculated by pressing <em>Calculate</em> button and can be plotted as a function of a number of parameters,
	which can be chosen from a drop-down box. The desirable parameter range can be entered using two text fields. Other Thompson source parameters are taken 
	from the main window of the program. The results of calculation can be saved as a text file using <em>Save</em> button.</p>
	
	<p>The brilliance calculation box also allows to choose whether the transversal velocity spread of the electrons is taken into account. The observation 
	angle and X-ray energy may be also specified if necessary.</p>
	
	<h2>Shadow menu</h2>
	<p>The <em>Shadow</em> menu allows one to generate a set of rays for the use as an X-ray source in Shadow ray-tracing software. 
	To choose the number of generated rays, the angular and energy ranges use <em>Shadow</em> -> <em>Parameters</em> dialog. The ray set is saved in
        binary Shadow format. A converter from binary to text format and from text to binary format can be launched from the <em>Shadow</em> as well.</p>
	
	<h2>Option menu</h2>
	<p>Option menu provides access to additional graph parameters via <em>Options</em> -> <em>Graph parameters</em> as well as to the numerical integration precision and the number of points in Monte-Carlo
	 calculation of the geometric factor via <em>Options</em> -> <em>Numerical parameters</em>. <em>Options</em> -> <em>Velocity spread</em> specifies whether the transversal 
	 velocity spread is taken into account in the main window calculations as well while generating a set of rays for Shadow.</p>
